# Bank-Management-System

Simple Bank System that lets users create an account with a basic registration system, not to mention deposit and withdraw money.

## Features

- We defined a BankAccount class with private member variables for account name and balance.
- We provided public methods (deposit, withdraw, display) for account operations.
- The main function allows the user to create a bank account with an initial deposit, before letting them deposit, withdraw, or display account information via a do-while loop.
- The switch statement in the main function handles user choices for banking operations.

## Technology used
